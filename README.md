## Project description
The project covered the entire process from data discovery to a functional application for end-user. It involved selecting the right machine learning algorithms and finding the best resources to understand them. Reusable functions were created for data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, making future projects more efficient.

## Language
- Python, with Visual Studio Code

## Take-aways
- Machine Learning algorithms to predict missingg values: Linear regression
- Machine Learning algorithms for classification True/False: K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Machine Learning alogorithms evaluation based on different scoring (like RÂ², accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.), and on data background
- Machine Learning fine tuning to avoid bias and overfitting (including cross-validation)
- Descriptive statistics: Skewness, Shapiro
- Feature engineering & dimension reduction with Principal Components Analysis
- Available python functions that can be reused for later projects
- Simple and functional application for end-user
